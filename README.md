# Velocity

Velocity is an experimental Machine Learning (ML) and Structure From Motion (SFM) imagery analysis project for vehicle speed estimation. This repository, [github.com/ultralytics/velocity](https://github.com/ultralytics/velocity), contains the code and documentation for these efforts.

## Requirements
To use Velocity, you will need Python 3.7 or later installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the following dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

The required Python packages are:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `torch`
- `opencv-python`
- `exifread`
- `bokeh` (optional)

In addition to Python, Velocity also requires [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or newer. You will need to clone the [functions-matlab](https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab) repository and add it to the MATLAB path with the following command:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('/path/to/functions-matlab'))
```

Velocity also relies on the following MATLAB toolboxes:
- `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
- `Signal Processing Toolbox`

## Running Velocity
To run Velocity, there are various methods available. Please contact us for further information.

# üöó Introduction

Welcome to the [Ultralytics Velocity](https://github.com/ultralytics/velocity) repository! Here, we delve into the intersection of [Machine Learning (ML)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) and [Structure From Motion (SFM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion) to estimate the speed of vehicles using image analysis. Our objective is to enhance vehicle speed estimation methodologies and provide a foundation for future research and practical applications in fields like [traffic management](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/ai-in-traffic-management-from-congestion-to-coordination) and [autonomous systems](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/autonomous-vehicles).

## üéØ Project Objectives

This project aims to leverage advanced [ML](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) and SFM techniques to accurately estimate vehicle speeds from various forms of imagery. By developing these methods, we hope to contribute valuable tools applicable to traffic monitoring, [autonomous driving systems](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions/ai-in-automotive), and road safety analysis.

## üì∏ Dataset

Currently, a public [dataset](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/benchmark-dataset) is not provided with this repository. The methods are designed for integration with custom datasets. If you possess relevant imagery or wish to collaborate on applying these techniques, please contact us. For general dataset needs, explore resources like [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) or public datasets like [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/).

# üìã Requirements

To execute the code within this repository, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Python 3.7+**: Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to set up the necessary libraries:

  ```bash
  pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
  ```

  The `requirements.txt` file includes essential Python packages such as:

  - [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/): Fundamental package for numerical computation.
  - [`scipy`](https://scipy.org/): Library for scientific and technical computing.
  - [`torch`](https://pytorch.org/): An open-source [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) framework ([PyTorch](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/pytorch)).
  - [`opencv-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/): [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library for [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) tasks.
  - [`exifread`](https://github.com/ianare/exif-py): Library to read Exif metadata from image files.
  - [`bokeh`](https://bokeh.org/) (optional): For interactive data visualization.

- **MATLAB 2018a or newer**: Some scripts require [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). Clone the common functions repository and add it to your MATLAB path:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
  ```

  Then, within MATLAB:

  ```matlab
  >> addpath(genpath('/path/to/functions-matlab')) % Replace /path/to/ with the actual path
  ```

  Ensure the following MATLAB toolboxes are installed:

  - `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
  - `Signal Processing Toolbox`

# üèÉ Run

This repository offers various methods for vehicle speed estimation using SFM and ML. While detailed run instructions are context-dependent, the core scripts leverage the libraries listed in the requirements. If you're interested in applying these techniques or need specific guidance on execution, please don't hesitate to reach out or raise an [Issue](https://github.com/ultralytics/velocity/issues).

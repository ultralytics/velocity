# üöó Introduction

Welcome to the [Ultralytics Velocity Estimation Project](https://github.com/ultralytics/velocity)! This repository is dedicated to the experimental exploration of machine learning (ML) and Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques for estimating the speed of vehicles from imagery data. If you're interested in advanced computations involving motion and velocity, hop in and learn more about our cutting-edge research.

# üìã Requirements

Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

### Python Dependencies

It's necessary to have Python 3.7 or later. Please install the following packages using pip:
```
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```
You should have the following Python packages installed:
- `numpy` - For numerical operations.
- `scipy` - Used for scientific computing and technical mathematics.
- `torch` - PyTorch, a popular deep learning library.
- `opencv-python` - For image processing tasks.
- `exifread` - To read EXIF data from images.
- `bokeh` - An optional dependency for interactive visualization.

### MATLAB Setup

A MATLAB installation (version 2018a or newer) is required with the following configurations:
1. Clone the common functions repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
```
2. Add the repository to your MATLAB path:
```
addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
```
Please ensure you have these MATLAB toolboxes installed:
- `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
- `Signal Processing Toolbox`

# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the [Ultralytics Velocity](https://github.com/ultralytics/velocity) repository! This project is at the forefront of combining Machine Learning (ML) and Structure From Motion (SFM) techniques to analyze visual data for estimating vehicle speed. Designed for researchers, engineers, and hobbyists interested in vehicular dynamics and automated systems.

# üìã Requirements

To use this repository, you'll need Python 3.7 or later, MATLAB >= 2018a, and various packages and toolboxes. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

## Python Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages by running the following command:

```
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the following packages:

- `numpy` - For numerical processing.
- `scipy` - Used for scientific computing tasks.
- `torch` - PyTorch, a framework for deep learning models.
- `opencv-python` - OpenCV for image and video processing.
- `exifread` - For reading EXIF data from images.
- `bokeh` (optional) - An interactive visualization library.

## MATLAB Setup

Ensure you have MATLAB >= 2018a installed. Additionally, clone the common functions repository and add it to the MATLAB path:

```matlab
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
```

Make sure you have the following MATLAB toolboxes installed:

- `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox` - For advanced analytics and machine learning.
- `Signal Processing Toolbox` - For signal processing tasks.

# üî® Run

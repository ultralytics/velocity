# üöó Introduction

Welcome to the [Ultralytics Velocity](https://github.com/ultralytics/velocity) repository! Here, we're exploring the frontiers of Machine Learning (ML) and Structure From Motion (SFM) to estimate the speed of vehicles using imagery analysis. Our goal is to advance vehicle speed estimation techniques and provide a springboard for further research and application in this area.

[![Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/velocity/actions/workflows/format.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ultralytics/velocity/actions/workflows/format.yml) <a href="https://ultralytics.com/discord"><img alt="Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/1089800235347353640?logo=discord&logoColor=white&label=Discord&color=blue"></a> <a href="https://community.ultralytics.com"><img alt="Ultralytics Forums" src="https://img.shields.io/discourse/users?server=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.ultralytics.com&logo=discourse&label=Forums&color=blue"></a>

## üéØ Project Objectives

This project aims to utilize advanced ML and SFM approaches to accurately estimate vehicle speeds from various forms of imagery. By doing so, we hope to contribute valuable tools and methods that can be applied in domains such as traffic monitoring, autonomous driving systems, and road safety enhancements.

## üì∏ Dataset

Currently, we do not provide a public dataset alongside this repository; the methods are tailored for use with custom datasets. If you have specific imagery or are interested in applying these techniques, please reach out for collaboration.

# üìã Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.7+**: Install Python and use pip to set up the necessary libraries:

  ```
  pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
  ```

  The `requirements.txt` file includes key Python packages such as:

  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `torch` (PyTorch)
  - `opencv-python` (OpenCV)
  - `exifread`
  - `bokeh` (optional, for visualization)

- **MATLAB 2018a or newer**: Besides Python, some scripts require MATLAB. Clone the common functions repository and add it to your MATLAB path with the following commands:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
  ```

  Then in MATLAB:

  ```
  >> addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
  ```

  Ensure you have the following MATLAB toolboxes installed:

  - `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
  - `Signal Processing Toolbox`

# üèÉ Run

The repository contains various methods for vehicle speed estimation. If you're interested in leveraging these techniques or require more information on running the code, please feel free to reach out.

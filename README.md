# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the [Ultralytics Velocity Estimation Project](https://github.com/ultralytics/velocity)! This repository is devoted to experimental algorithms in Machine Learning (ML) and Structure From Motion (SFM) focusing on the analysis of imagery for vehicle speed estimation. This innovative application of ML and computer vision techniques has implications in traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicles, and many other areas where vehicle dynamics are essential.

# üìã Requirements

To get started with this project, you will need Python and MATLAB with specific libraries and toolboxes. Here's what you need:

### Python üêç
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later. Then, install the following required libraries by running the pip command:
```sh
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```
The `requirements.txt` includes:
- `numpy` - For numerical operations and handling arrays
- `scipy` - Used for scientific computing and technical computing
- `torch` - PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library
- `opencv-python` - OpenCV, for computer vision tasks
- `exifread` - To read EXIF data from image files
- `bokeh` (optional) - A library for interactive visualizations

### MATLAB üìä
You will need [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or newer. Additionally, make sure to clone the common functions repository and add it to your MATLAB path:
```matlab
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
```
MATLAB toolboxes required:
- `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox` - Provides functions and apps to describe, analyze, and model data.
- `Signal Processing Toolbox` - Offers a variety of filtering, analysis, and visualization capabilities.

# üèÅ Run

To execute the velocity estimation algorithms, please refer to the specific scripts provided in the repository for detailed instructions. If you need more information or assistance, feel free to contact us.
